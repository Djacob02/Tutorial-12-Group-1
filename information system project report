Executive Summary 

Problem Definition
Choosing travel packages can be time-consuming and difficult due to the vast amount of information available online. 
The first step in design thinking is to emphasise with the customer to determine their requirements for the new system. 
Empathising with the customer means to observe, listen and engage with them.
Second step is to define the problem once the customer needs are understood. 
Furthermore, the new system will allow calls from customers to be routed to certain relationship managers 
who can help them choose the right holiday package.
The relationship manager will differentiate customers on the basis of the Profiler tool which contains 
all of the customers information like name, age, and culture.
The information provided in the Profiler will increase the possibility of the relationship manager 
landing and closing a sale with the customer. 
The information provided in the Profiler allows the relationship manager to build a connection with the customer 
which is vital in making a sale. 
Thus, the call management system will add significant value to the organisation and will help improve current work processes.
Therefore, the CMS will provide a way to automate current processes within the travel company which currently require human intervention. 

Objectives 
The main objective of this project is to introduce an upgraded call management centre system,
to improve the operations of a major travel company, helping them generate more sales. 
Due to the varying number and nature of their products, holiday packages, their current system is complicated, 
so the new system aims to provide a tool which simplifies this, and matches customers with specific Relationship Managers 
who can provide tailored services according to their skill profiles. 
The project implementation will enable the ability to provide a more specific
and efficient service and establish strong customer relationships, resulting in repeat sales.

'How Might We' Statements 



Reflection on Assumptions 

After analysing the travel company’s situation, it is assumed that there are enough Relationship Managers (RMs) every day, 
and the same RMs are hired on a full-time work type, meaning they have the same shift every day of the week, 
maintaining consistency of their service offering. All RMs are assumed to have basic knowledge of all travel packages 
being offered by the travel company, however are not required to specialize in all product areas. Hence, RMs are assumed 
to have the capability to be able to transfer their customer on a call to a different RM, who can assist their specific 
requirements. This may occur if the first RM was wrongly matched to the customer by the system, if the RM knows that another 
RM can handle their customer’s enquiries better, or other relevant reasons. Additionally, it is assumed that customers have 
the ability to discover the different packages the travel company offers, through other media platforms such as advertisements,
a website and social media.
