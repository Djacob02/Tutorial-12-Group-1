Executive Summary 

Problem Definition
Choosing travel packages can be time-consuming and difficult due to the vast amount of information available online. 
The first step in design thinking is to emphasise with the customer to determine their requirements for the new system. 
Empathising with the customer means to observe, listen and engage with them.
Second step is to define the problem once the customer needs are understood. 
Furthermore, the new system will allow calls from customers to be routed to certain relationship managers 
who can help them choose the right holiday package.
The relationship manager will differentiate customers on the basis of the Profiler tool which contains 
all of the customers information like name, age, and culture.
The information provided in the Profiler will increase the possibility of the relationship manager 
landing and closing a sale with the customer. 
The information provided in the Profiler allows the relationship manager to build a connection with the customer 
which is vital in making a sale. 
Thus, the call management system will add significant value to the organisation and will help improve current work processes.
Therefore, the CMS will provide a way to automate current processes within the travel company which currently require human intervention.
